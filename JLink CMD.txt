Device     Selects a specific device J-Link shall connect to
           and performs a reconnect.
           In most cases explicit selection of the device is not necessary.
           Selecting a device enables the user to make use of the J-Link
           flash programming functionality as well as using unlimited
           breakpoints in flash memory.
           For some devices explicit device selection is mandatory in order
           to allow the DLL to perform special handling needed by the device.
